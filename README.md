NLAC (Normalization, Lookup, And Conversion) is a high performance command line application that normalizes input data (from a csv file) and outputs ABC file note data. This data can then be loaded into sheet music creation software, such as Musescore, to create sheet music where the pitch of notes represents the changes in the input data.  

NLAC was originally created as a high performance backend library for Melodigraph and is best used as a collection of C# classes to achieve this, however, some command line functionality exists mainly for testing.
